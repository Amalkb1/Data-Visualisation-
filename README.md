# Data-Visualisation-
I've completed Task 3 of "Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights" using Tableau! The dashboard visualizes monthly revenue trends, revenue vs. quantity by country, top 10 customer revenue, and total revenue by country. This offers crucial insights into business performance and sales distribution.
Task 3: Unveiling Key Business Insights with Tableau Dashboard
Just wrapped up Task 3 of the "Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights" course using Tableau! This task focused on building a comprehensive dashboard to visualize critical sales and revenue metrics, providing a clearer picture of business performance.

Key Dashboard Components & Insights:

Monthly Revenue Trend: Visualized the moving average of monthly revenue, showing overall growth and identifying peak periods (around month 10-12). This helps in understanding seasonal patterns and long-term revenue trajectories.
Revenue vs. Quantity by Country: Explored the relationship between revenue and quantity sold across different countries. The bar chart highlights that while some countries like B. El. and Fr. have high revenue, understanding the quantity sold alongside helps identify differences in average transaction value or product mix. The use of a logarithmic scale for the value axis allows for better comparison across varying magnitudes.
Revenue by Top 10 Customers: Identified and ranked the top 10 customers by revenue. This insight is crucial for understanding customer segmentation, identifying high-value clients, and potentially tailoring marketing or retention strategies. Customer ID 14096 and 17841 clearly stand out.
Total Revenue by Country (Geographical View): A map visualization showcasing total revenue by country, providing a geographical perspective on sales distribution. This helps in identifying strong markets (e.g., Netherlands, USA, Hong Kong) and areas with potential for growth.
This dashboard provides a powerful, interactive way to monitor revenue performance, understand customer behavior, and analyze sales distribution globally. Excited to apply these skills to more complex datasets!
